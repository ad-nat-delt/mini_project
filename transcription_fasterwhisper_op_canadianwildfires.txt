[0.00s -> 6.14s]  Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air quality alerts throughout the U.S.
[6.54s -> 10.82s]  Skylines from Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy.
[11.24s -> 15.56s]  And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside.
[16.04s -> 19.72s]  We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DiCarlo,
[20.14s -> 25.26s]  an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
[25.66s -> 26.32s]  Good morning, Professor.
[27.56s -> 28.56s]  Good morning.
[28.56s -> 37.12s]  So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away?
[38.88s -> 40.26s]  Well, there's a couple of things.
[40.56s -> 45.66s]  The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the U.S.
[45.96s -> 50.56s]  is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires
[50.56s -> 55.74s]  through Pennsylvania into the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.
[56.08s -> 58.52s]  So what is it in this haze that makes it?
[58.68s -> 60.54s]  It's harmful, and I'm assuming it is harmful.
[62.42s -> 62.92s]  It is.
[63.00s -> 63.26s]  It is.
[63.36s -> 66.44s]  The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy,
[66.96s -> 71.58s]  and most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny particles,
[72.24s -> 74.52s]  microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair,
[75.02s -> 79.82s]  that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular system,
[80.26s -> 82.40s]  and even your neurological, your brain.
[83.14s -> 85.44s]  What makes this particularly harmful?
[85.60s -> 87.40s]  Is it the volume of particulate?
[88.06s -> 88.40s]  Is it something?
[88.56s -> 90.30s]  You know, what is it exactly?
[90.38s -> 92.02s]  Can you just drill down on that a little bit more?
[93.40s -> 98.16s]  Yeah, so the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have,
[98.26s -> 103.50s]  was reaching levels of what are, in science speak, 150 micrograms per meter cubed,
[103.58s -> 107.06s]  which is more than 10 times what the annual average should be
[107.06s -> 113.00s]  and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24-hour average.
[113.12s -> 118.38s]  And so the concentrations of these particles in the air are just much, much, much higher
[118.38s -> 123.22s]  than we typically see, and exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems.
[123.38s -> 124.82s]  And who is most vulnerable?
[125.02s -> 128.58s]  I noticed that in New York City, for example, they're canceling outdoor activities,
[128.58s -> 132.86s]  and so here it is in the early days of summer, and they have to keep all the kids inside.
[132.96s -> 136.12s]  So who tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?
[137.44s -> 142.32s]  It's the youngest, so children, obviously, whose bodies are still developing,
[142.56s -> 145.22s]  the elderly, who are, you know, their bodies are more in decline,
[145.32s -> 148.06s]  and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of breathing,
[148.06s -> 152.62s]  the poor air quality, and then people who have pre-existing health conditions,
[152.70s -> 154.44s]  people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions,
[154.52s -> 156.46s]  can be triggered by high levels of air pollution.
[157.28s -> 158.58s]  Could this get worse?
[162.08s -> 163.06s]  That's a good question.
[163.38s -> 166.90s]  I mean, I think if, in some areas it's much worse than others,
[167.00s -> 169.76s]  and it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated.
[170.90s -> 173.82s]  I think New York has some of the higher concentrations right now,
[173.88s -> 176.58s]  but that's going to change as that air moves away from the New York area.
[176.96s -> 178.04s]  But over the course of the next year,
[178.06s -> 181.80s]  over the next few days, we will see different areas being hit at different times
[181.80s -> 183.20s]  with the highest concentrations.
[184.04s -> 188.94s]  Unless more fires start burning, I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much higher.
[189.24s -> 191.08s]  I was going to ask you, and you started to answer this,
[191.16s -> 193.34s]  but how much longer could this last?
[193.44s -> 196.18s]  And forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what do you think?
[198.06s -> 200.34s]  Well, I think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer,
[200.50s -> 203.68s]  but the key for us in the U.S. is the weather system changing.
[203.68s -> 207.82s]  And so right now, it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air into our,
[208.06s -> 210.94s]  mid-Atlantic and northeast region.
[211.12s -> 215.96s]  As those weather systems change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere
[215.96s -> 219.06s]  and not impact us in this region as much.
[219.20s -> 220.98s]  And so I think that's going to be the defining factor.
[221.02s -> 225.02s]  And I think the next couple of days, we're going to see a shift in that weather pattern
[225.02s -> 227.36s]  and start to push the smoke away from where we are.
[227.94s -> 231.96s]  And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires.
[232.16s -> 237.96s]  Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide-ranging air quality conflicts?
[238.06s -> 239.60s]  Will we be seeing consequences or circumstances?
[241.20s -> 246.00s]  I mean, that is one of the predictions for climate change looking into the future.
[246.42s -> 251.08s]  The fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, and we're seeing more frequent fires.
[251.30s -> 255.30s]  So, yeah, this is probably something that we'll be seeing more frequently.
[255.70s -> 257.94s]  This tends to be much more of an issue in the western U.S.,
[257.94s -> 261.36s]  so the eastern U.S. getting hit right now is a little bit new.
[262.04s -> 264.64s]  But, yeah, I think with climate change moving forward,
[264.80s -> 267.26s]  this is something that is going to happen more frequently.
[268.06s -> 272.50s]  That's Peter DiCarlo, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering
[272.50s -> 274.72s]  at Johns Hopkins University.
[274.82s -> 278.10s]  Professor DiCarlo, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us.
[279.36s -> 280.34s]  Thank you for having me.
[282.20s -> 282.30s]  Thank you.
